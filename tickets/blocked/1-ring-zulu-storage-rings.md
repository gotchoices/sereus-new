description: Implement Ring Zulu participation and storage ring opt-in (blocked on Arachnode)
dependencies: Arachnode storage system (not yet built), packages/cadre-core profile configuration
----
Blocked on the Arachnode storage ring system not being built yet.

The profile distinction between `transaction` and `storage` currently has no real effect beyond FRET hints. Once Arachnode is available:

- **Ring Zulu (Transaction)**: all nodes participate in transaction verification and ephemeral caching
- **Storage rings** (Ring 3 → 2 → 1 → 0): storage-profile nodes join the appropriate concentric ring based on capacity
- Profile configuration in CadreNode should map to actual ring participation

## Blocked on
- Arachnode storage ring system design and implementation

## TODO
- [ ] Integrate Ring Zulu participation into CadreNode start
- [ ] Implement storage ring opt-in based on profile and capacity
- [ ] Map CadreNodeConfig.profile to actual ring participation
- [ ] Update FRET profile hints to reflect real ring membership
