description: Optional provider enhancements: Kubernetes operator, auto-scaling, multi-region
prereq: packages/cadre-provider, ops/docker
----
The provider service (`@serfab/cadre-provider`) has core functionality complete. These are optional enhancements for production-scale deployments.

- **Kubernetes operator**: custom resource definitions for cadre containers, automated lifecycle management
- **Auto-scaling**: scale drone containers based on demand (strand count, connection load)
- **Multi-region deployment**: geo-distributed provider nodes for latency and redundancy

These are low priority and can be deferred until the core system is battle-tested.

## TODO
- [ ] Research Kubernetes operator patterns for container lifecycle
- [ ] Design auto-scaling triggers and thresholds
- [ ] Design multi-region topology and data routing
